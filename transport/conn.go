	// A deadline is an absolute time after which I/O operations
	// fail with a timeout (see type Error) instead of
	// blocking. The deadline applies to all future and pending
	// I/O, not just the immediately following call to Read or
	// Write. After a deadline has been exceeded, the connection
	// can be refreshed by setting a deadline in the future.
	//
	// An idle timeout can be implemented by repeatedly extending
	// the deadline after successful Read or Write calls.
	//
	// A zero value for t means I/O operations will not time out.

	// A zero value for t means Read will not time out.

	// SetWriteDeadline sets the deadline for future Write calls

	// Even if write times out, it may return n > 0, indicating that
	// some of the data was successfully written.
	// A zero value for t means Write will not time out.
